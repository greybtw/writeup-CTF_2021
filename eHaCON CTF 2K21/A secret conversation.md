## Solution
Actually, I always brute force with challengs just has a single page as this challenge. I got an endpoint `/cgi/test-cgi`, after a lot of times try to find vulnerability in this endpoint, I decied to bought hint ðŸ˜€ and I got 
```
Mark has achieved somthing in the year 2010
```
Search about `Mark Nottingham` in 2010


We saw something related to `RFC` right? It's  `RFC 5988` in 2010. 


Click it to view more detail and find with key `2010`. I got 2 papers was released in 2010

The next step is search about 2 RFC standard in CTF
- `RFC 5988`
- `RFC 5785`
I tried with `5988` first, when it was failed I step to `5785` and got a endpoint ðŸ˜€ `.well-known` 

Access the file `flag.txt` to capture the flag
```
Flag is : EHACON{rfc_fr0m_13tf}
